## Installation:

1) *Set up 2projectors(1 for coffee table, 1 for the wall/screen), and ensure that the cables are properly connected to UR44(amplifier) to the speakers from the laptop and properly powered on*
**The cable from the laptop to the amplifier is USB type B to USB type A**

***Also ensure that the driver is working properly in the amplifier for the speaker to be in working condition***

2) *Have a LGX AvaMedia CaptureCard (for livestreaming the game onto the table and screen)*

3) *Ensure that the cables are connected from the laptop that you are going to livestream the game and the media server to the CaptureCard before output it to the 2projectors*

4) *Once that is done,would need to **install Christie Pandora Box with the licence** to do the meshing of the video and dual live output onto the table and screen*

=======
### **Unity Hub**


5) *Install Unity Hub before installing the Zip folder of the game*

6) ***Unzip folder** of the game and opening it in Unity Hub*

7) ***Build and run** the game and you should be good to go*
