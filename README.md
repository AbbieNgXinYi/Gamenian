## Installation phase
**[(Back To Top)](#top)**

### Lighting Installation
1) In this setup, we use LED Strips to hang up on top of of the metal truss to light up the area.

![Alt text](images314Github/20230720_161215.jpg)
![Alt text](images314Github/20230720_161154.jpg)

2)The LED Strips was connected using FlexOled LEDJ FTP3 driver. This driver have to set to the correct DMX address by pushing up the correct slider (Eg if the DMX address is 451 switch the slider 1,2,7, 8, and 9 to the ON position)

![Alt text](images314Github/SGCAM_20230510_161238932.jpg)

3) The LED Driver was connected to the grandMA3 onPC 2K node via the DMX to terminal block cable. The grandMA3 onPC software is required to control and set the lighting cues and the effects for the LED Strips.

![Alt text](images314Github/20230720_161629.jpg)
![Alt text](images314Github/20230720_161440.jpg)


4)The grandMA3 software can be downloaded in the website via this link 
:https://www.malighting.com/downloads/products/grandma3/

### Video Installation
**[(Back To Top)](#top)**

1) In our setup, we have 2 projectors setup(1 for table, 1 for the projection screen)

![Alt text](images314Github/-6339063505319213120_121.jpg)

2) The position of the projector for the table is faced down while the projector for the projection screen is faced forward.

![Alt text](images314Github/SGCAM_20230530_173849279.jpg)

3) Both projectors would be connected to the media server via HDMI.
   We required the use of 2 DP to HDMI Adapters as the server only accepts DP and we only had HDMI cables.

![Alt text](images314Github/SGCAM_20230606_143235204.jpg)

![Alt text](images314Github/SGCAM_20230606_165027870.jpg)

4) Due to the distance of the projector and media server being a few meters away from each other, we used 2 pairs of
   HDMI extenders to increase the reach for the HDMI cables.

![Alt text](images314Github/SGCAM_20230606_165220717.jpg)

5) Note: HDMI Extenders help ensure proper and stable cable management
    * Help reduce hardware issues that relate to the cabling like:
        1) lose connection
        2) Cable being pulled out
    * Extenders run on LAN cables for extension
        1) LAN cables have a locking mechanism while HDMI cables do not. This ensures that aren't lose or pulled out easily.

6) Next, we would connect the media server to the laptop via LAN to project out our content.

![Alt text](images314Github/SGCAM_20230606_143222420.jpg)

7) In our setup, we will be using a capture card(Aver Media) connected via USB-A to USB Micro B to the media server and
   laptop as we will be live streaming our content through christie pandora box(Projection mapping software).

![Alt text](images314Github/SGCAM_20230606_143539821.jpg)

8) In order to use christie pandora box, we require a dongle(License to use pandora box) for the media server and the laptop.
